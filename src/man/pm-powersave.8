.SH "FILES"
.PP
\fI/etc/pm/power\&.d/\fR, \fI/usr/lib/pm\-utils/power\&.d/\fR
.RS 4
When you run
\fBpm\-powersave\fR
it combines the scripts in these two directories and executes them in sorted order\&. If both directories contain a script with the same name, the one in /etc/pm/power\&.d/ has a higher precedence and only this one will be executed\&.
.sp
Therefore to disable a script from /usr/lib/pm\-utils/power\&.d/ simply create an empty file in /etc/pm/power\&.d/ with the same name and without the execute bit set\&.
